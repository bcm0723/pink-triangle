<h2>PINK TRIANGLE이란 무엇인가</h2>
<p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_triangle" target="_blank" title="link">A pink triangle</a></u></strong> has been a symbol
 for various LGBTQ identities, initially intended as
 a badge of shame, but later reclaimed as a positive symbol
 of self-identity. </p>

<p>In Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, it began as one of
the Nazi concentration camp badges, distinguishing those impr
isoned because they had been identified by authorities as homo
sexual men, a category that also included bisexual men and t
ransgender women.</p> <p> In the 1970s, it was revived as a symbo
l of protest against homophobia, and has since been adopted by
 the larger LGBTQ community as a popular symbol of LGBTQ pride
  and the LGBTQ rights movement</p>
